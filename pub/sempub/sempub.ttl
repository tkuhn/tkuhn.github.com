:GenuineSemanticPublishingCriterion1
	dct:title "First criterion of genuine semantic publishing: machine interpretability" ;
	dct:description "With genuine semantic publishing, a scientific work needs to come with formal representations that are semantic, in the sense that they are not just machine processable but machine interpretable, and that are linked so they add to the existing formal body of knowledge." .

:GenuineSemanticPublishingCriterion2
	dct:title "Second criterion of genuine semantic publishing: essential coverage" ;
	dct:description "With genuine semantic publishing, the semantic representations might be underspecified but need to have essential coverage in the sense that they cover (at least) the core of the main claims of the given work." .

:GenuineSemanticPublishingCriterion3
	dct:title "Third criterion of genuine semantic publishing: authenticity" ;
	dct:description "With genuine semantic publishing, the semantic representations need to be authentic in the sense that the respective authoritative persons create or approve the semantic representations. Domain data can only come from the researchers, and meta data has to come from the people responsible for the form of the published work, i.e. the researchers and/or the editors." .

:GenuineSemanticPublishingCriterion4
	dct:title "Fourth criterion of genuine semantic publishing: primary component" ;
	dct:description "With genuine semantic publishing, the semantic representations need to be a primary component of the published work, made available together with everything else at the time of publication. They must furthermore have an independent existence in their own right and not merely be appended or attached to the main entity as noncommittal extra data." .

:GenuineSemanticPublishingCriterion5
	dct:title "Fifth criterion of genuine semantic publishing: fine-grainedness" ;
	dct:description "With genuine semantic publishing, the semantic representations and their containers need to be fine-grained and light-weight. Even though such semantic representations might often be published in larger collections, the publication of minimal additions and corrections needs to be possible without a large overhead." .
