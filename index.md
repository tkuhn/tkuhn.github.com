### About Me

I am a postdoctoral associate at Yale working on controlled natural languages, knowledge representation and text/image mining. In addition, my fields of interest include artificial intelligence, the semantic web, software engineering, automated reasoning, rule systems, computational linguistics, bioinformatics, and logic programming.


### Projects

- MOLTO is a project on multilingual online translations
- Attempto is a research project dedicated to the development and application of the controlled natural language ACE
- ERGO is a project dedicated to research on how formal methods can improve the development and application of medical guidelines
- REWERSE was a research network of excellence on "Reasoning on the Web"


### Products

- Yale Image Finder is a search engine for images in biomedical publications
- AceWiki is a semantic wiki based on controlled natural language
- ACE (Attempto Controlled English) is a subset of natural English that can be automatically translated into formal logic
- ACE Editor is a controlled natural language editor
- Ontograph is a framework to test and compare the understandability of controlled natural languages and other logic languages
- Codeco is a grammar notation specifically designed for controlled natural languages and predictive editors
- AceRules is a rule system based on ACE
- Coral is a query interface for annotated text corpora
- bchart is a LaTeX package for drawing simple bar charts
